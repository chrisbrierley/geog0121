## Practical Description
This practical will introduce the Budyko (1969) model. This simple model looks solely at the fluxes & heat transports between various latitude bands and then calculates and equilibrium climate state. The notebook first describes the science behind the model and then codes up the model in python. It finishes with some questions that you can test by altering the input parameters of the model.
